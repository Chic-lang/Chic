# Testing

Chic tests are written in Chic and executed with `chic test`. Tests are declared with `testcase` and typically use the standard assertion helpers from `Std.Testing`.

## Start here

- Writing `testcase`s: `docs/testing/inline_testing.md`
- Assertions: `docs/testing/assertions.md`

## CLI

- Run tests for the current package: `chic test`
- Run tests for a specific project: `chic test path/to/package`
