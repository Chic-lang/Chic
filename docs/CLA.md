# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

> **Not legal advice.** Review with legal counsel before adopting.

## License Grant (License-Grant Style)

By submitting a contribution to this repository, you agree to the following:

> **License Grant.** You grant Chad E Vogel (“the Company”) a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, create derivative works of, sublicense, and relicense your Contributions, in source and object form, under any terms selected by the Company. You represent that you have the necessary rights to grant this license and that your Contributions are your original creation or you otherwise have sufficient rights to submit them. You waive (or, where not waivable, agree not to assert) moral rights to the extent necessary to exercise the foregoing rights, and you grant a patent license for any patents you own or control that would be infringed by your Contributions.

If your organization prefers copyright assignment instead of a license grant, adapt the clause to say:

> “You hereby assign all right, title, and interest (including copyright) in the Contributions to the Company…”

Provide a back-license so contributors can continue using their work. For background on assignment models, review the Free Software Foundation’s rationale.

## Operational Notes

- Pull requests must include confirmation that the contributor has signed the CLA (see `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the PR template checklist).
- The “CLA Assistant” GitHub Action records signatures in the `cla-signatures` branch (at `signatures/cla.json`) and sets a required status check on pull requests.
