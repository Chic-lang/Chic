# Changelog

This changelog tracks **breaking, user-visible changes** to the Chic language and the core runtime contract (things that can break existing Chic programs or compiled artifacts).

- Changes to individual libraries / Std packages should be documented in their own package notes instead of this file.
- Pure refactors, internal cleanups, performance work, and tooling changes generally do not belong here unless they change user-visible behavior.

## Unreleased

### Breaking changes

- None.
