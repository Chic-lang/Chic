# Chic CLI

The `chic` command is the Chic bootstrap toolchain. It provides a small set of verbs for creating projects, building, running, testing, and generating documentation.

## Project resolution

Commands that operate on projects (`build`, `run`, `test`, `coverage`, `clean`) accept a single optional “project input”:

- No argument: use the current directory.
- A directory: use that directory.
- A file: use the parent directory of that file.

From that root, the CLI discovers `manifest.yaml` (the project file) and, when present, `manifest.workspace.yaml` (workspace defaults).

## Common workflows

- Build the current project: `chic build`
- Run the current project: `chic run`
- Run tests: `chic test`
- Run tests with coverage: `chic coverage --coverage-min 90`
- Clean build outputs: `chic clean` (or `chic clean --all`)
- Generate Markdown docs from XML docs: `chic doc` (see `docs/tooling/documentation.md`)

## Outputs and artifacts

By default, build outputs land under `./obj/` (intermediates) and `./bin/` (final artifacts), partitioned by target triple and configuration.

To write artifacts somewhere else, pass `--artifacts-path <dir>` to build-like commands (and to `chic clean` when cleaning a custom artifacts root).

## Getting help

- General help: `chic --help`
- Command help: `chic help <command>`
- List commands: `chic help`
