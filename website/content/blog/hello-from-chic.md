Chic is an **alpha** programming language and toolchain designed for **AI-first development**: tight, structured feedback loops that make it practical to build and maintain software with automated agents in the loop.

This project is not production-ready yet. Expect sharp edges, incomplete features, and breaking changes as the language, runtime, and tooling stabilize.

If you’re new here:

- Start with the **mission** (`docs/mission.md`).
- Follow the **getting started** guide to build the `chic` CLI and run a first build.
- Read the **language tour** for a practical introduction to the language’s surface area.

We’ll use this blog for updates that summarize what’s changing, what’s still experimental, and where help is welcome.
