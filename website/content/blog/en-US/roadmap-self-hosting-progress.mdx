Chic’s mission includes two long-running themes that affect almost every design choice:

1) **Deterministic workflows**: predictable builds, stable outputs, and caching that keys off content rather than timestamps.
2) **Self-hosting**: over time, moving more of the compiler/toolchain and standard library implementation into Chic itself.

In v1 of the website and docs integration, we’re focusing on making the project easier to learn and contribute to — without claiming that any given roadmap milestone is “done” until it’s documented and tested.

If you want to help, the best starting point is to browse issues and pick something small and well-scoped.
