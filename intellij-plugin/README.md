# Chic IntelliJ Plugin (Scaffold)

This folder contains a minimal IntelliJ Platform plugin scaffold for Chic. It is intentionally small and is tracked by issue `#42`.

## Current scope

- Registers `.cl` as “Chic” files.
- No LSP wiring yet (planned to connect to `impact-lsp` over stdio).

## Next steps

See `docs/tooling/intellij_plugin.md`.
